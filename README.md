- Architectures & Components
  - MVVM Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel)
  - Repository Pattern
  - ViewModel - Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - LiveData - An observable data holder class.

  - SwipeRefreshLayout - Implement the swipe-to-refresh UI pattern.
- The Room persistence - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- Retrofit2 & OkHttp3 - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM.
- Dagger - A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.
- Glide, GlidePalette - Loading images from network.
- Material-Components - Material design components for building CardView.
- ProgressView - A polished and flexible ProgressView, fully customizable with animations.
